# Hangman-Game
## The hangman game using javascript

Welcome to the Hangman game.  The theme of the game is all things Texas.  The word puzzles will be related to Texan culture, geography, and typical vocabulary.

To get started simply press a letter on the keyboard. If the letter typed matches a letter in the word, the underline corresponding to the position within the word of that letter will be replaced by the typed character.

The player has 15 guesses to find the entire word.  If the word is found with less than 15 guesses, the player scores a win. If after 15 guesses the player is unable to find the word, a loss is recorded.

Note that only letters can be typed and count as a guess.  An alert will appear if the player types a non-alpha character. If the player types a character that has already been guessed, the player does not lose a turn.

When the player finds the hidden word or reaches the maximum number of guesses, the game will reset and a new word puzzle will appear.
